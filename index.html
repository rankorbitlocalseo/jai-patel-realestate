  <!-- New Construction Properties Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Streamlining the Search for New Construction Properties</h2>
    <p>In a growing area like Stittsville ON, new construction sales have become increasingly popular. Buying agents are instrumental in this niche market, helping clients evaluate different builders, compare upgrade packages, and navigate timelines for construction.

  <!-- Property Sales Management Section -->

    <h2>Coordinating the Details Through Property Sales Management</h2>
    <p>Behind the scenes, agents are also deeply involved in property sales management, which involves organizing documents, deadlines, and communications. From managing timelines to ensuring legal compliance, they coordinate all moving parts of the transaction. This includes liaising with mortgage lenders, home inspectors, legal advisors, and title companies. With a buying agent at the helm, the process remains organized and on track, reducing the risk of costly delays or errors.</p>
